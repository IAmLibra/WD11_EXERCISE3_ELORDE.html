    <p>Buho Rock is a coral rock shaped like a small ship docked at a port in one of the cliffs of the Western Poblacion.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is situated in one of the few public beach resorts on the island.
        
        It is a great place to be as a viewing deck to explore <br>
         the turquoise waters of Camotesâ€™ ocean with your naked eyes.
        
        For you to really enjoy your stay on this particular site <br>
         cottages have been built with native-style roofs and open sides, and sits and tables are available, of course.</p>

    <p>They also snorkel, swim, and even dive from that structure then swim back to the nearby shore and climb up the stairs.

        Being not a private establishment, Buho Rock allows visitors to bring in their food or snacks to enjoy better the view.</p>
