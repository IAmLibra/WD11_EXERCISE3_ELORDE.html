    <h1>[CAMOTES] THE LOST HORIZON OF THE SOUTH</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Have you heard of the Lost Horizon of the South? Yes it was named the “Lost Horizon of the South” because of its unspoiled beauty. <br>
        Imagine the pristine crystal clear water, the powdery white sand, fresh environment and the breath taking view of the sunset.<br>
         Get upclose to the nature as it’s one of the best of the few things to do when you get to Camotes Island. <br>
         That is Camotes group of Islands which is part of the province of Cebu. Located  off the coast of the City of Danao.</p>

    <p>History says that centuries ago when the Spanish colonizers first arrived, they came across with a few native islanders <br>
        and asked what was the island’s name. The locals thought the Spaniards were asking about what they were putting up in their baskets.<br>
         Since the natives were digging potatoes, locally known as Camote, they replied Camote. That’s when people started calling them the “Camotes Island” or “Potato Island”.</p>
    <h1>Camotes consists of four islands</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Pacijan Island</li>
        <li>Tulang Island</li>
        <li>Ponson Island</li>
        <li>Poro Island</li>
<br>

    </ul>
    <img src="port.jpg" height="500px">
    <p>Pacijan and Poro island are joined together by a paved pathway called a causeway while Ponson is separated <br>
        by the Camotes sea and lying approximately about four kilometers northeast of Poro Island. Tulang Island on the other hand is located at the Northern part of Pajican.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are also four municipalities in the Island of Camotes- It’s Tudela, Poro, San Francisco and Pilar.</p>
